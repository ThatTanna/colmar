# HTML + CSS Assessment: Colmar Academy

This project was completed as part of Codecademy's Build-a-Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages Path.  
The aim was to learn how to build capstone project websites, which we were required to apply everything we had learned so far to build a responsive site from scratch.   

Our main task was to create a landing page for a new school, Colmar Academy.  
We were provided with resources like wireframes, images and a video, we were then instructed to make all remaining design decisions to complete the site.  
Responsive design techniques and media queries were utilized to create desktop and mobile versions of the web page.

We decided to use mainly grid for this assessment.
